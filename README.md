Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped into any Express-based web application.

A JSON Web Token, popularly known as JWT, is an open standard that defines a compact way for securely sharing information between two parties: a client and a server.

Passport-jwt strategy lets you authenticate endpoints using a JSON web token. It is intended to be used to secure RESTful endpoints without sessions.

Unlike the traditional server-side sessions — which save a session ID in memory and return it to the client — this standard creates a self-contained and digitally signed token that is verified each time a request is made.
